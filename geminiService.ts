    - Sowing Date: ${zone.crop?.sowingDate || 'N/A'}
    - Current Stage: Assume it's in a mid-growth vegetative stage.
    - Zone Area: ${zone.area} acres

    **Latest Soil Test Results (from ${soilTest.sampleDate}):**
    - pH: ${soilTest.ph}
    - Nitrogen (N): ${soilTest.nitrogen} ppm
    - Phosphorus (P): ${soilTest.phosphorus} ppm
    - Potassium (K): ${soilTest.potassium} ppm
    - Organic Matter: ${soilTest.organicMatter}%

    Based on all the provided data, determine if irrigation and/or fertilizer application is necessary today.
    - For irrigation, consider the recent precipitation and upcoming forecast.
    - For fertilizer, consider the crop's growth stage and the soil nutrient levels.
